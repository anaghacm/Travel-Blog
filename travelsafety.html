                <img class="w-100 img-thumbnail mb-5" style="height:100vh;" src="./images/safetytravel.jpg" alt="">
                <p>With things finally getting back to normal after 2 years of a global catastrophe,
                    everyone is excited to pack their bags and hit the road. Admit it; you’d be lying if you
                    said you didn’t miss traveling and exploring the globe over the past few years.<br><br>


                    Now that we can travel again, it’s important to do so safely. With that in mind, we put
                    together the ultimate guide on how to stay safe while traveling abroad (especially if you
                    plan to travel solo). And now more than ever, there’s more to safety than just physically
                    taking care of yourself and so have also included a couple of essential tips on how to stay
                    safe from a digital perspective too. Let’s dive in!<br><br>

                    <b> PLAN AHEAD AND SHARE THAT PLAN WITH A FRIEND/FAMILY MEMBER</b><br><br>

                    An important step toward ensuring safety during travels is planning ahead. Sure, spontaneous
                    adventures may sound more fun, but they’re also more dangerous. If you want to put safety
                    first (as you should), plan your trip ahead and map out where you want to be and when.
                    <br><br>

                    Having an outline of your next steps and travel plans makes traveling more accessible and
                    safer, which in many cases is more enjoyable than having to deal with the pressure of not
                    knowing what could happen next. Even if you’re the kind of person who prefers spontaneity,
                    plan your trips to stay safe and healthy.<br><br>


                    We also recommend giving a copy of your itinerary (and travel insurance cover) to a trusted
                    friend or family member who isn’t traveling with you. This way if anything untoward should
                    happen, it will be easy to narrow down where you were supposed to be at any particular
                    time.<br><br>

                    <b> DOWNLOAD (+ LEARN HOW TO USE) A VPN</b>
                    <br><br>

                    OK, so ‘learn how to use’ a VPN might be a bit of a stretch – for most you literally just
                    toggle them on and off. But protecting your data and online accounts while you are away is
                    paramount – especially if you need to access them on the move and plan on using public WiFi
                    (more on that below).
                    <br><br>

                    Free WiFi comes in handy when traveling to new places and exploring new streets you’ve never
                    seen. To take advantage of the available public internet, download a VPN or virtual private
                    network. A VPN meaning is quite easy to understand – a virtual private network completely
                    hides your activities online and makes you private on the network. That way, your data, and
                    devices will remain safe even if you connect to an unprotected, open WiFi network.<br><br>
                    <b> MAKE COPIES OF YOUR IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS</b><br><br>
                    Have multiple copies of your passport and driver’s license – a hard copy to carry with you,
                    and scanned, digital copies in a password-protected account online. This way, should the
                    worst happen with your actual passport (lost, stolen, destroyed etc), the copies can help
                    identify you, and help get replacement passports quicker.<br><br>
                    <b> TELL YOUR BANK WHERE YOU ARE GOING</b><br><br>
                    There is nothing worse than your card being declined while you are on the road – especially
                    when it is because your bank has seen you are in a different country and put a block on it.
                    <br><br>
                    Avoid the hassle by letting your bank know which country you are going to, and then when you
                    pay with your card abroad, it won’t be flagged by the bank as a suspicious
                    transaction.<br><br>
