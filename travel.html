                    Greece</h3>
                <img class="w-100 img-thumbnail mb-5" style="height: 100vh"
                            src="./images/greece.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>There’s no denying how much I love Greece! It’s a country that’s filled with beautiful places
                                to visit and history and culture that’s second to none, especially in the gorgeous Cyclades
                                Islands. From gorgeous islands like Santorini and Mykonos – to lesser-known gems, there’s a
                                heap of the best islands to visit in the Cyclades that you can’t miss whilst in Greece.
                                <br><br>
                                Not only does Greece have some beautiful islands to explore, but it also has some incredible
                                cities; I’m naming you, Athens! Plus, there are lots of beautiful places to see on the
                                mainland, too; and that’s even before we get onto all the delicious Greek dishes to devour
                                on your trip! <br><br>
                                You see, each of the Cyclades Islands is totally different. Each with its own vibe and is
                                perfect for different kinds of trips that make it perfect for whatever type of holiday
                                you’re looking for. Best of all, they’re well-connected (either by ferry or flight) and
                                pretty easy to navigate… even if the ferries are sometimes late (just something to watch out
                                for). <br><br>
    
                                So, to make your trip planning that bit easier, we wanted to share some of the best islands
                                to visit in the Cyclades that you can visit when in Greece. <br><br>
                                
                                <h5>1. Santorini </h5> <br><br>
                                Probably one of the best-known Greek places to visit, Santorini is something of a popular
                                island in the Cyclades to visit.<br><br>
    
                                This can be something of a double-edged sword… it’s totally beautiful (gorgeous in fact),
                                has plenty of international connections to the airport and you’ll be spoilt for choice with
                                great hotels, too. But, that does mean that it can get super busy at the peak times of year
                                (and can get quite expensive, depending on where you stay).<br><br>
    
                                <h5>2. Mykonos</h5><br><br>
    
                                Often known as the party island of Greece, Mykonos is so much more than its glamourous beach
                                clubs and on-trend bars. Yes, that is part of Mykonos (and a fun part if you fancy going for
                                a party.<br><br>
    
                                In fact, I’d go as far as saying it’s one of the best islands to visit in the Cyclades if
                                you fancy a good mix of fun, history and a gorgeous Greek Island. You can easily spend a
                                week visiting Mykonos, taking in Mykonos Town, spending time on the beaches and just
                                chilling – we loved it for that.<br><br>
                                <h5> 3. Milos</h5><br><br>
                                Milos is one of the best islands to visit in the Cyclades to visit for its gorgeous
                                coastline. It’s just incredible and has been something of a favourite with Greek people for
                                many decades. Filled with beautiful coves, gorgeous beaches and the iconic Sarakiniko Beach
                                (on the north part of Milos) it’s a spot that’s best enjoyed chilled.<br><br>
    
                                After arriving be sure to spend some time enjoying the crystal-clear waters of Sarakiniko.
                                Just be sure to take plenty of sunblock and drinks and snacks with you; there are no
                                amenities here and the sun can get really intense.<br><br>
    
                                Don’t forget to book an intimate boat tour (less than 10 people) around Milos, too. These
                                will get you to the hidden spots around the west part of Milos that are all inaccessible by
                                land. You’ll take in the likes of Kleftiko and the cave of Sykia which are just so
                                beautiful.<br><br>
