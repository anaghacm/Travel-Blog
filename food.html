                            <p>There’s nowhere quite like Italy when it comes to ice creams (or gelato, as the locals would
                                call it). Italy is renowned the world over for its ice creams and there isn’t a single city
                                or town you’ll visit in Italy where you won’t find some homemade ice cream parlour. It’s one
                                of my favourite things about Italy and judging from the reactions on here (and on
                                Instagram), I’m not alone on this. <br><br>
    
                                Randomly, I just found out that the very first ice creams were invented in Ancient Greece
                                where snow was mixed with honey and fruit in Athens to give ancient ice creams. (Similar
                                things happens across the world in different places over 2,000 years ago!) <br><br>
    
                                Suffice to say, though, Italian are (arguably) the world experts these days when it comes to
                                making ice creams. They’re so good at it that none of it really needs to be mass produced –
                                it’s done in relatively small batches, in fairly small operations that result in people
                                spending just that extra time and care to ensure they give you the best offering
                                possible.<br><br>
    
                                This is all to varying extents of course. Some places are just absolutely amazing at the
                                stuff, some places aren’t so great. <br><br>
    
                                In the past, the fact that the gelato was homemade was enough to know it was good but these
                                days, it’s trickier to tell which places are good and which ones are – short of having to
                                memorise the best ice cream parlour in every town, city and village all across
                                Italy!<br><br>
    
                                Here’s where I come in. Over several years of visiting Italy, of which every trip has pretty
                                much involved eating gelato around the clock, I’ve developed a knack of knowing where to
                                find the best ice cream in Italy and where to avoid.<br><br>
    
                                I can’t take all the credit though, a lot of my knowledge of where to go for ice cream in
                                Italy has been down to the locals I’ve met.<br><br>
    
                                I’ve been on many a food tour, dined with locals, met up with my Italian friends in their
                                cities, gone on road trips with Italian (at one point, I was in Italy at least once every
                                month for over a year #humblebrag… haha!) and it’s really thanks to the knowledge gleaned
                                from them that I am able to share some quick and easy tips on where to find the best ice
                                creams (gelato) in Italy.<br><br>
    
                                <h5> 1. Look out for the colours.</h5><br><br>
    
                                More specifically, look out for the colours in pistachio and bananas. If the pistachio is
                                bright green or the banana bright yellow, this ain’t the gelateria for you. The reason being
                                that neither of those two naturally come in that colour. Naturally, pistachio is actually
                                more light brown in colour and banana is more light grey in colour.<br><br>
    
                                Pistachio, in particular, is an important one as it’s an expensive nut as so lower quality
                                ice cream parlours tend to use different nuts (e.g. almonds) to make the ice cream and just
                                add in artificial colouring and/or flavouring.<br><br>
    
                                <h5>2. Check the consistency</h5><br><br>
    
                                The nature of how artisanal gelato is made means that unlike lower quality Italian ice
                                creams, the good gelato tends to be fairly viscous* and can’t be piled high like cheap ice
                                cream can. This is because really good quality gelato doesn’t have as much air in it, due to
                                how it’s churned (which is great because it means you get more flavour in your ice cream).
                                <br><br>
                                Point is, good gelato tends to lose its shape when piled high and just tend to fall back
                                flat whereas the lower quality ones will hold their shape a lot more (very much like most of
                                your store-bought ice creams).<br><br>
    
                                <h5> 3. Look our for seasonal fruits</h5><br><br>
    
                                Have you ever bought strawberries out of season? They look great, feel great and end up
                                tasting more like sour lemons than strawberries. It’s so frustrating (especially so as I’ll
                                refuse to throw it away and instead wince through every single one as I try to finish the
                                punnet). The same goes for grapes, plums…etc.<br><br>
    
                                My (rather long-winded) point here is that if you walk into a gelateria in winter and find
                                strawberry ice creams, perhaps be a tad wary. It’s not saying that the ice cream parlour is
                                bad in particular – it’s just saying that you might want to avoid the non-seasonal ones to
                                avoid disappointment.<br><br>
    
                                Clearly, you can still get seasonal fruits out of seasons – thanks to amazing supply chain
                                networks all across the world but the very best ingredients are the ones that are in season
                                and haven’t had to travel too far.<br><br>
